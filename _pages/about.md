## Biography
Hi! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Stony Brook University. Before that, I received an M.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University in 2023 and a B.E. degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from University of Shanghai for Science and Technology in 2020. Currently, my research interest mainly lies in machine learning for power systems.
