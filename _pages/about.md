## Biography
Hi! I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Stony Brook University. Before that, I received an M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University in 2023. My research focuses on machine learning in power systems, particularly for microgrid modeling, resilience enhancement, and dynamic behavior verification.
