## Biography
Hi! I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Stony Brook University. Before that, I received an M.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University in 2023. Currently, my research interest mainly lies in machine learning for power systems.
